Program: A function that prints out the first 10 reversible prime squares
############################################################################

The program is comprised of multiple functions, each which check the multiple stipulated conditions which are to:
 
1. First check whether the number is a prime number or not:

The function checks through multiple operations such as modulo 				 	 devision, futher using mathematical concepts to evaluate a wide range of numbers and thus retrieving strictly prime numbers.
	
2. Second is the square function:
 The function squares the extracted prime numbers.
 
 3. Third is the reverse function:
  The reverse function reverses the squared prime numbers
  
 4. Following the reverse function is the comparison/palindrome function
  the palindrome function checks the reversed square number from the reverse   function and compares it with the original square number to make sure its no palindrome, if it is, then the program terminates
 
 5. should the the palindrome function be passed, then the main function  outputs a prime square along with its reversed prime square.
